                                living in the streets begging for food, money, and other necessities to survive. Did you know that three

                                Their lives have become more miserable when COVID-19 and the lockdown happened. 
                                Homeless people also usually live in squatter and crowded areas which makes them 
                                have more chances of getting infected with this deadly virus.</p>

                                  <ol>In the Philippines, homeless families and children are often judged easily and looked down at as if they were criminals. 
                                   Aside from all the obstacles they go through every single day, they also have no choice but to face such discrimination.</ol>

                                  <ol>Most children living on the streets lack food and medical care which may result in poor physical health.
