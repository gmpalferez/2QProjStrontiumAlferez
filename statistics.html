                                <p>As you can see from the bar graph on the left, our country has the largest percentage of 
                                households who are financially struggling in this time of the pandemic. This is due to the 
                                loss of jobs or the reduced work hours of at least one family member in 70% of the households 
                                in the Philippines. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, around 4.2 million were 
                                unemployed as of February 2021. Moreover, 80% of the Filipino respondents who had money troubles 
                                were forced to reduce in either their food consumption, utilities, or nonessential daily expenditures 
                                so that the income they have left would last longer. However, Rappler foresees that even with these 
                                cost-cutting strategies being practiced, half of the Filipino households would only survive for two 
                                weeks.</p>

                                  <p>On the left side, we can see another table that would show the changes brought by the 
                                  arrival of the pandemic specifically to the Filipino families and the whole Philippine population. 
                                  If we look at the Magnitude of Poor (in million), an additional 3.88 Filipinos were pushed to poverty. 
                                  One of the factors that aggravated this was the Monthly Poverty Threshold for a Family of Five (PhP). 
                                  Back in 2018, an amount of ₱10,532 was already sufficient to buy all the necessities and food for a 
                                  family with five members. However, three years later, the amount raised and is currently ₱12,082. We 
                                  can assume that the prices of food significantly increased when we look at the Monthly Food Threshold 
                                  for a Family of Five (PhP) category.</p>
