                                <h2>Educate Filipino families about Family Planning</h2>
                            </div>
                            <div class="content-text">
                                <p>Studies have shown that families with more members are more associated 
                                with higher poverty incidence, gap, and severity. This will also cause the 
                                Philippine population to grow which would aggravate the performance of the 
                                economy. According to Springer Link, rapid population growth would reduce 
                                per capita income growth and more lands being occupied which tend to increase 
                                poverty incidence. Therefore, I really think that the government must organize 
                                family planning programs especially in impoverished areas, where poor families 
                                reside. The government must also set funds aside to provide contraceptives and 
                                birth control for the said families. If these programs are implemented consistently, 
                                the growth rate of the population will hopefully slow down.</p>

                                <h2>Making Improvements in the Agricultural Sector</h2>
                            </div>
                            <div class="content-text">
                                  <p>Since the majority of poor people work as farmers and fishers, I think that 
                                  the government must invest more on agricultural productivity and provide capital 
                                  for functioning irrigation systems and a well ordered transport infrastructure. 
                                  Since the Philippines is an archipelago with low-lying coastal areas, they must 
                                  also invest in improving the resilience of rural areas just in case climate change 
                                  and a disaster occur. We also must not forget to take care of the welfare of the 
                                  farmers and others who work in the agricultural sector since the income they get from 
                                  farming is small and not enough to sustain a comfortable life. Therefore, I think the 
                                  government must also assist them financially by increasing the wage for farmers.</p>

                                <h2>Expand access in Education and Healthcare</h2>
                            </div>
                            <div class="content-text">
                                  <p>One of the major factors of systemic poverty is the childrenâ€™s lack of 
                                  education and healthcare. Obviously, they both need both of these things in 
                                  order to keep track of their health and the skills and knowledge they would 
                                  learn from school would prepare them for future job opportunities. Although 
                                  the government already conducted programs to address these problems like the 
                                  Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act (2017) or the Universal
                                  Healthcare Act (2019), there are still children being left out and we cannot 
                                  tolerate that. One specific and simple solution to this issue is to implement 
                                  child tax credit which aims for providing financial assistance to low-income 
                                  parents and their children. This has been widely practiced in the USA, especially 
                                  during the pandemic, and results have shown that it reduced child poverty and increased 
                                  family social mobility.</p>
