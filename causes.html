                                <p>All progress of economic growth on poverty over the years would be suddenly 
                                dampened if an episode of high inflation occurs. A study has found out that a 
                                10% increase in food prices would put an estimated 2.3 million additional people 
                                to poverty while a 10% increase in necessities other than food would put 1.7 
                                million people at risk. With the prices of food and necessities going high, poor 
                                people, especially those with families, are left with the option to abandon health 
                                care, education, and more. The study also identified that during a period of time 
                                in the Philippines, inflation caused the severity of poverty to rise by about 17%.</p>

                                  <p>The failure of the Philippine’s economy to generate employment for the large 
                                  sectors of the poor explains the lack of job opportunities within the country. 
                                  With an alarming number of people being unemployed, they don’t have enough income 
                                  and are very vulnerable to poverty. The industrial and manufacturing employment, 
                                  where stable and high quality jobs are found, also declined over time. The 
                                  employment in agricultural jobs went from 61.2% to 36.1% in a span of 47 years. 
                                  The result of this decline can’t sustain income opportunities, especially in provinces 
                                  where most poor people and families live. On the other hand, the service sector is 
                                  doing better because most of it is urban-based which took up most of the labor force.</p>

                                  <p>The study was able to record high levels of inequality for 25 years which further 
                                  diminished moderate economic growth. The year where inequitable distribution became 
                                  severe was back in 2006, where 3.5 affluent Filipino families accounted for 53% of 
                                  the total family income. In contrast, 13.9 indigent Filipino families were left with 
                                  the remaining small 47% of the total family income. Therefore, whenever economic growth 
                                  is making progress, it would benefit the rich people more.</p>
